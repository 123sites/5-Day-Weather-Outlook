# Weather-Outlook
## Description ✏️

- Acceptance Criteria
I made a weather dashboard that would run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.  It shows the weather outlook for multiple cities, so anyone using it could plan a trip accordingly.  I used [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather information and used local storage to store the information.

1) It has a weather dashoard with form inputs.
2) When searching for a city, there's current and future conditions.
3) That city is added to the search history.
4) When viewing current weather contions for that city it has the city name, date, 
   and icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
5) Future weather conditions show: A 5-day forecast that displays the date, 
an icon representation of weather conditions, the temp., wind speed, & humidity.
6) When clicking onto a city in the search history, there's current and future conditions.
   * Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:
   * Uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data.
   * Uses `localStorage` to store persistent data.
