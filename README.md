# Weather-Outlook
## Description ✏️

- Acceptance Criteria
I made a weather dashboard that would run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.  It shows the weather outlook for multiple cities for 5 days.  I used [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather information and used local storage to store the information. In addition:

1) It has a weather dashoard with form inputs.
2) When searching for a city, there's current and future conditions.
3) That city is added to the search history.
4) When viewing current weather conditions for that city it has the its name, date, 
   and icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
5) Future weather conditions show: A 5-day forecast that displays the date, 
   an icon representation of weather conditions, the temp., wind speed, & humidity.
6) When clicking onto a city in the search history, there's current and future conditions.
   This satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:
   * Uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data.
   * Uses localStorage to store persistent data.
